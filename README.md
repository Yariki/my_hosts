# My "hosts" file for Windows
Unified hosts with bloked fakenews, gambling, porn, social and some ukrainian popular sites (mostly for work :D ).

## Location of your hosts file
To modify your current `hosts` file, look for it in the following places and modify it with a text
editor.

**Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Linux**: `/etc/hosts` folder.

**Windows**: `%SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` folder.

## Reloading hosts file
Your operating system will cache DNS lookups. You can either reboot or run the following commands to
manually flush your DNS cache once the new hosts file is in place.
